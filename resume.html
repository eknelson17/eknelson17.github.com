          <h3>USER EXPERIENCE INTERN - CAMBRIDGE, MA<br />
          HUBSPOT 6/14-8/14</h3>
          <p>
            Did a full analysis of the HubSpot marketing software UI to root out holes. I identified the elements that didn't conform to the internal style guide as well as standard principles of good design. I also created a Sketch 3 version of the style guide to speed up the mock-up process.

          <h3>CO-OP IN HUMAN FACTORS - BEDFORD, MA<br />
          THE MITRE CORPORATION, E542/J85E – OPEN SERVICES 6/13-12/13</h3>
          <p>
            Designed and implemented a UI for a personnel recovery system using Ruby, Sinatra, jQuery, Bootstrap, and CouchDB. I created all interaction, the look and feel, and formatting. I crafted a usable, interactive web form from the pieces of the old PDF form the system will replace.
