=====================

My personal profile site written on top of a [Chocolate Chip Muffin](http://richbray.me/muffin/) template using Jekyll, SASS and Bootstrap.

I'm just getting started on this rewrite, so please forgive the lack of functionality. My current (and functional) site can be found at [eknelson17.com](http://eknelson17.com). If you take a look around you'll see why I'm rewriting - I know so much more about web development now than I did when I wrote my current site as a school project just over a year ago. I want to put my new knowledge and skills to use to create something much more sustainable that isn't a pain to update. (The content is all correct and up-to-date on the old site.)
