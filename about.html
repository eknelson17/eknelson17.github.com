    I am a fourth year Software Engineer at Rochester Institute of  Technology (RIT). I am concentrating in Human-Computer Interaction and User Interface Design on the technical end and Literature on the liberal arts side. I love working on front-end projects. Web is my main focus at this point as it is so versatile in what you can do design-wise. I advertise myself as a software engineer with a flair for design, because I have the brain of an engineer but a passion for good design and smooth user experiences. I am always striving to build the skills of both an engineer and a designer with the goal of being a User Experience Engineer and eventually the manager of a front-end design and development team.

    This semester I am studying abroad at the University of Limerick in Ireland! I'm super excited to experience living as a part of another culture. You can follow my adventures on my <a href="http://www.eknelson17.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eknelson17/">flickr</a> pages.

    Outside of class, I'm involved in the Society of Software Engineers (SSE). Last year, I was the Head of Public Relations. As a part of that role I spoke to companies and alumni about visiting to give talks, make donations, and about how awesome our members are. I also helped with all the open houses by talking about SSE, leading tours, and answering any and all questions sent my way. A new initiative I started is the SSE Ambassador program. Before the PR committee was a one-man operation. With the advent of the ambassador program, the PR committee is now an elite team of individuals trained to work with companies and interact with prospective students.

    One of my passions has always been making music. I started playing piano at the age of 4 and joined my first choir when I was 9. Now as a college student, I play in the clarinet section of the RIT Pep Band. The band plays at all the Men's and Women's home hockey games and any other event we're invited to play. Check out some of our past performances on our YouTube Channel: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheRITPepBand" class="link">TheRITPepBand</a>.

    I also love reading. I was raised on books, not TV and video games - shocking for someone in my field, I know. I'll read almost anything I can get my hands on, but my favorites are Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter.
