    I am a fourth year Software Engineer at Rochester Institute of 
    Technology (RIT). I am concentrating in Human-Computer Interation 
    and User Interface Design on the technical end and Literature 
    on the liberal arts side. I love working on front-end projects. 
    Web is my main focus at this point as it is so versitile in what you can 
    do design-wise. I advertise myself as a Software Engineer with a 
    flair for design, because I have the logical brain of an engineer 
    but a passion for good design and smooth user experiences. I also 
    am constantly working to build the skills of both an engineer and 
    a designer with the goal of being a User Experience Engineer and 
    eventually a manager of a front-end design and development team.

    Outside of class, I'm involved in the Society of Software 
    Engineers (SSE). Last year I was the Head of Public Relations. As 
    a part of that role I spoke to companies and alumni about visiting 
    to give talks, making donations, and about how awesome our members 
    are. I also helped with all the open houses by talking abou SSE, 
    leading tours, and answering any and all questions sent my way. A 
    new initiative I started is the SSE Ambassador program. 
    Before the PR committee was a one-man operation. With the advent of 
    the ambassador program, the PR committee is now an elite team of 
    individuals trained to work with companies and interact with 
    prospective students. The ambassadors are also working to get the 
    alumni committee off the ground and to unify the social media used 
    by SSE.

    One of my passions has always been making music. I started playing 
    piano at the age of 4 and joined my first choir when I was 9. Now as 
    a college student, I play in the clarinet section of the RIT Pep Band. 
    The band plays at all the Men's and Women's home hockey games and 
    any other event we're invited to play. Check out some of our past 
    performances on our YouTube Channel:

    I also love reading. I was raised on books, not tv and video games - 
    shocking for someone in my field, I know. I'll read almost anything I 
    can get my hands on but my favorites are Jane Austen's Pride and 
    Prejudice and J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter.
