  I've done all sorts of projects since starting college. The categories below are meant to showcase some of my best and most relevant work. I started out doing almost strictly software development then progressed to doing user interface design. The print projects are mostly work from my design courses and work I've done on promotional materials for clubs. Finally, photography has been a passive hobby of mine for years, but with my decision to study abroad, I chose to step it up. I'm sharing my best work and my favorites here.
