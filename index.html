			I am absolutely in love with technology, and I firmly believe that
			good design is an integral part of a solid product. With this belief 
			in mind, I have directed my attention to usability, human-computer 
			interaction, and front-end development. I am a software engineer at heart; 
			however, so I understand the underlying implementation of a website 
			or application is just as important as making the UI aesthetically 
			pleasing.

			to network with, so please email me or contact me on any of the 
			social networks linked to the right.
