	<!-- The below content could really use some reworking...doesn't quite say what I want it to at this point. Just need to work on wording. The content is more or less ok. -->

	<p>
		I am absolutely in love with technology, and I firmly believe that
		good design is an integral part of a solid product. With this belief 
		in mind, I have directed my attention to usability, human-computer 
		interaction, and front-end development. I am a software engineer at heart; 
		however, so I understand the underlying implementation of a website 
		or application is just as important as making the UI aesthetically 
		pleasing.

		Check out the other pages to find out more about who I am and what I 
		do. I'm always searching for new opportunites and interesting people 
		to network with, so please email me or contact me on any of the 
		social networks linked to the right.
