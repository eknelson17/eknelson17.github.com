    I am absolutely in love with technology, and I firmly believe that
    good design is an integral part of a solid product. With this belief
    in mind, I have directed my attention to usability, human-computer
    interaction, and front-end development. I am a software engineer at heart;
    however, so I understand the underlying implementation of a website
    or application is just as important as making the UI aesthetically
    pleasing.
